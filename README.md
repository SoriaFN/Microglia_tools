# Microglia_tools
ImageJ macros to analyse microglial cells in live or fixed tissue.
*This is work in progress. Some scripts need to be merged, and some need to be rearranged for a more coherent workflow.*

## How to use
1. Click on the ImageJ/FIJI script (".ijm" file) you want to download.
2. Click on "Raw"
3. Save page as .ijm file
4. Drag and drop the ijm file onto FIJI (or install macro in ImageJ)

## Current macros (Feb 2021)
### Immunofluorescence
- **Microglia_Morphology**  A script to calculate Form factor, Density and Fractal Dimension from binary images of individual cells.
### 2-photon timelapse
- **MIP_timelapse**  A script to generate registered Maximal Intensity Projections from tridimensional time-lapse images (hyperstack with xyzt).
- **Pixels_surveyed**  A script to calculate instantaneous and cumulative area surveyed by microglia in two-photon time-lapse images.
