# Microglia_tools
ImageJ macros to analyse microglial cells in live or fixed tissue.

## Current macros (Feb 2021)

### Immunofluorescence
- **Microglia_Morphology**  A script to calculate Form factor, Density and Fractal Dimension from binary images of individual cells.

### 2-photon timelapse
- **MIP_timelapse**  A script to generate registered Maximal Intensity Projections from tridimensional time-lapse images (hyperstack with xyzt).
- **Microglia_pixels_surveyed**  A script to calculate instantaneous and cumulative area surveyed by microglia in two-photon time-lapse images.

***This is work in progress. Some scripts need to be merged, and some need to be rearranged for a more coherent workflow.***
